### What I learned

**Dale Cottrell:**

While working on this project I was able to learn additonal methodologies in code problem solving envolving react-particles, react-scroll, react-reveal and typewriter-effect. I brushed up on my version control. My most valuable experience was the challenge of building out a large complex app that entialed multi modules which overlaped while employing the programing Languages and code libraries listed above. I used Skillful problem solving in pre-build and real-time build-out to developed my portfolio App with quality while meeting the time line requirements laid out by the lead.
